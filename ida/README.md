## IDA Python sctipts used to disassemble DNN executables
 - ida_batch.py: run IDA scripts from the Windows cmd
 - ida_lst.py: get the lst file (disassembly output) generated by IDA
 - ida_string.py: get the strings detected by IDA
 - ida_split_funcs.py: split IDA lst file into seperate assembly functions
 - dataset_pre_label.py: label assembly fucntions according to their names (to generate dataset for training)
 - refine_glow_labels.py: refine labels of assembly functions generated by Glow
 - remove_section.py: some DNN executables can be huge (>500Mb), disassembling such binaries would take IDA a long time, so we use this script to strip data section from DNN executables to boost the disassembling process.
